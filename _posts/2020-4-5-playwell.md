Working with Jason from Playwell Bricks Studio was lots of fun. our first collaboration was a really complex MOC print on all sides. Printing this required 5 different jig and countless hours of setup up and test prints but the result was really satisfying for millionprints, Playwell and the customers who bought this MOC
