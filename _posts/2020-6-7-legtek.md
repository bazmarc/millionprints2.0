From brick badges to minifig to trophy tiles, Leg Tek 2020 was ready for their first LEGO show ever.

##### To support LegTek, * millionprint will reprint the reverse side of those bricks for 2021 as well as add 2021 on the tiles, at no cost to LegTek. Now lets just hope all goes well between now and then and that 2021 events don't get canceled as well.
