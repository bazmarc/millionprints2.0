QuéLUG member Patrick Simard came to me with request for special prints for his MOC, he provided me with the pictures of the real truck he based his MOC on and identified on what LEGO parts he wanted certain prints to be on. We worked together to make sure all the details he wanted where properly reproduced and the result is stunning (admitidly his MOC was amasing even before the prints)

Fun Fact,  Patrick's MOC Hitachi EH3500 AC-3 won the MOC of the MONTH in QuéLUG monthly month contest - Congratulation
