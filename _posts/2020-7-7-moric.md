Nice example of internal use branding,  Moric created this double sided full color torso print and had students build their own minifig using lots of minifig parts that they sources from their local LEGO store.

First, the torso are placed in a custom print jig,

Then the grid was printed over a vinyl to ensure logo would come out ceneterd.  After a few ajustement we were ready to print hundreds of little moric torsos!
