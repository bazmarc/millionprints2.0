In the infographic above I try to explain how certain parts can be printed and why.

Model: UV Printer Mimaki UJF3042-FX   
Max print area: 300mm x 420mm  
Max bed clearance: 50mm  
Ink colors Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black, White and Clear

Because the bed can lower max 5cm i'm able to print on object as thick as large LEGO wheels.  In this case a special primer is applied to the rubber to ensure adequate "display" level print adherence.
