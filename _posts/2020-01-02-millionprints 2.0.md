# A short story on how millionprints got its 2.0

In January 2020 <a href="#">millionprints</a> got a major upgrade when it replaced its current digital UV printer - a cheap Brotherjet(Artisjet) clone from China to a new (well almost new) MIMAKI UJF-3042FX UV flatbed printer, a renoun brandname from Japan. This has allowed millionprints to up its game in quality prints on LEGO® or any other hard flat surfaces up to 5cm in height.  Imerse yourself in the world of millionprints 2.0 and enjoy this portfolio of job made on this new printer.

Below a few picture of the setup of the new printer in my shop
